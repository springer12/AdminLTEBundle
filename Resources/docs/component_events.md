# Accessing components

The contents of the navbar and sidebar are separated into components, following an event driven approach.

The general process to use a particular component is to create an event listener and to use the given event object to add ui elements.

Each component has its own event and specific ui data interfaces.

## Available events

TODO kevin - add more documentation on events

## Next steps

Please go back to the [AdminLTE bundle documentation](index.md) to find out more about using the theme.
