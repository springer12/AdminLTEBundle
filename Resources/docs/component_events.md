# Accessing components

The contents of the navbar and sidebar are separated into components, following an event driven approach.

The general process to use a particular component is to create an event listener and to use the given event object to add ui elements.

Each component has its own event and specific UI data interface.

## Available events

Until this is properly documented, please see the [theme events](https://github.com/kevinpapst/AdminLTEBundle/blob/master/Event/ThemeEvents.php) interface for all available events.

TODO kevin - add documentation on events

## Next steps

Please go back to the [AdminLTE bundle documentation](README.md) to find out more about using the theme.
